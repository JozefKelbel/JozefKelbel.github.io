   "In Flanders Fields"
<br>
In Flanders fields the poppies blow
Between the crosses, row on row,
That mark our place: and in the sky
The larks still bravely singing fly
Scarce heard amid the guns below.
<br>
We are the dead: Short days ago,
We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,
Loved and were loved: and now we lie
In Flanders fields!
<br>
Take up our quarrel with the foe 
To you, from failing hands, we throw 
The torch: be yours to hold it high
If ye break faith with us who die,
We shall not sleep, though poppies grow
In Flanders fields"<br><br>
       By: Mcrea <br> Is the most famous poem of that era.</p></div>
    <div class="facts" id="fact7">It was not just men who went to war. In World War I, many Australian women volunteered as cooks, drivers, interpreters and other skilled positions. Female nurses served in countries such as Egypt, France and Greece, often in dangerous conditions, close to the frontline where they were exposed to shelling.</div>  
    <div class="facts" id="fact8">Every year, nations around the globe fall silent for one minute at 11am on the 11th day of the 11th month to remember those who have served their country during war.</div>
    <div class="facts" id="fact9">Remembrance day also known as Memorial Day is observed and mourned internationally.</div>
   
   <button id="mainfact">About?</button>
   <div class="facts" id="fact10">Remembrance Day (sometimes known informally as Poppy Day) is a memorial day observed in Commonwealth of Nations member states since the end of the First World War to remember the members of their armed forces who have died in the line of duty. Following a tradition inaugurated by King George V in 1919, the day is also marked by war remembrances in many non-Commonwealth countries. Remembrance Day is observed on 11 November in most countries to recall the end of hostilities of World War I on that date in 1918. </div>
